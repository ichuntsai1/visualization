        <h3>Research Method</h3>
       <blockquote>
        <h3>Research Questions</h3>
        <p>The goal of this AI Exploration day workshop is to help 8th grader raise their awareness of AI in real-life and their understanding of how AI technologies are designed to support the needs in real-life experience. The following research questions will be addressed in the study: </p>
<ol><li>1.	How do students’ awareness and understanding of AI technologies change after participating in the AI Exploration Day workshop? </li>
<li>2.	How do students’ level of AI awareness impact students’ learning of AI concepts, learning motivation of learning AI technologies, and learning satisfaction of the workshop? </li>
<li>3.	How do students perceive their learning satisfaction and motivation of learning AI technology through the AI Exploration day workshop? </li></ol>

<p>To answer the research questions, data were collected through <b>1)</b> the application form of the AI Exploration day workshop, <b>2)</b> workshop feedback survey, <b>3)</b> grades/feedback of AI competition. 
</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        	 	
        <h3>A. Application Form of AI Exploration Day:</h3>
        <p> To better arrange students into small groups for AI-PBL project, 2 questions related to students’ perception of their knowledge/experience about AI and their strengths of work in a collaborative group were asked. The data collected through these questions examined how students’ prior experience impact their learning and performance of the AI Exploration day workshop.</p>  
              </blockquote>
        
        <h3>B. Workshop Feedback Survey:</h3>
        <p>The workshop feedback survey whose learning satisfaction questions (4 questions) and workshop evaluation questions (4 questions) developed based upon Alavi’s (1994) learning and evaluation scales and 10 motivation questions adapted from the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ, Duncan & McKeachie, 2005) were implemented in the end of the workshop to explore how students respond to AI materials, sessions, and AI-PBL competition. The data of students’ learning satisfaction and motivation of learning AI technologies in the workshop will help examine how to better support students and motivate students when integrating AI technologies into school curriculum. In addition to the motivation and learning satisfaction questions, the workshop feedback survey also examined students’ understanding of knowledge-based concepts of AI technologies and students’ perception of AI technologies, including potential benefits, risks/challenges, significant future impact, and ethical considerations of AI technologies. The data helped explore how much students have learned from the workshop.</p>  
        </blockquote>
        
    	<h3>C. AI Competition:</h3>
        <p>Once students have attained basic understanding of AI technologies, students were given 2.5 hours to brainstorming and design the AI prototypes to support their summer activities and vocation. A rubric to determine winner of the competition based upon 1) the understanding of the problem, 2) creativity, unique solution, and solution viability of the AI prototypes, 3) understanding of solution limitation and responsible use, and 4) overall presentation of AI prototypes were utilized by 6 AI mentors to grade and provide feedback. The grades and feedback collected help examine the relationship between students’ AI porotypes design to their learning experience in the workshop.</p>
