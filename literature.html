        <h3>Literature Review</h3><br/>

        <h3>AI in K-12 Education.</h3>
        <p>AI has become increasingly prevalent in various industries and aspects of daily life, and its impact is expected to grow in the future (Daugherty & Wilson, 2018). As a result, there is a growing need for AI education in K-12, to prepare students for the future job market and equip them with the necessary skills to thrive in an AI-driven world (Caines, 2020). One of the main arguments for integrating AI education into K-12 is the potential for AI to transform various industries and create new job opportunities (Manyika et al., 2017). A report by the McKinsey Global Institute estimates that AI could create between 70 million and 230 million new jobs globally by 2030, but it could also displace up to 800 million jobs (Manyika et al., 2017). Therefore, it is crucial to prepare students for the changing job market and provide them with the necessary knowledge and skills to succeed in an AI-driven world. Several studies have shown that AI can be integrated into K-12 education in various ways. For example, AI can be used to personalize learning experiences and provide students with tailored feedback (Holmes et al., 2019). AI can also be used to create engaging and interactive learning environments, such as virtual reality and gaming (Bower et al., 2019). Moreover, AI can be used to teach programming and computational thinking skills, which are essential for the future job market (Brennan & Resnick, 2012). Our students use AI technologies in their daily life; however, studies have shown that students lack awareness, knowledge, and skills of AI technologies, which can hinder their ability to fully benefit from AI-powered educational tools and been vulnerable when expose their records through AI technologies (Long & Magerko, 2020). A report by the European Commission (2019) found that only 1% of European students have AI-related skills, and only 17% of students have basic digital skills. The lack of AI literacy can also lead to misconceptions and misinformation about AI technologies and their ethical implications (Lee & Tan, 2019). It is suggested that K-12 education must prioritize AI literacy and provide students with the necessary resources and opportunities to develop AI-related awareness, knowledge, and skills. Thus, the AI Exploration Day workshop is aimed to raised students’ awareness, knowledge, and skills of AI application in K-12. </p>   </blockquote>

        <h3>Design Thinking.</h3>
        <p>Design thinking is a problem-solving approach that emphasizes empathy, creativity, and experimentation to develop innovative solutions (Brown & Katz, 2011). It is a human-centered model that encourages collaboration, experimentation, and iteration to create products, services, and experiences that meet people's needs and desires (Plattner, Meinel, & Leifer, 2011). The design thinking model consists of five stages: empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test (Brown, 2008). The first stage of the design thinking model is empathize, which involves understanding the user's needs, perspectives, and experiences. It is found that empathizing with users led to the development of a more effective and engaging educational application (Leong, Chai, Ong, & Lwin, 2019). The second stage is define, which involves analyzing and framing the problem, and the third stage: ideate involves generating a wide range of ideas and concepts. The fourth stage is prototype, which involves creating a physical or digital representation of the solution, and the final stage: test is to evaluate and refine the solution. This model is adapted in the workshop to guide students to design and develop their AI prototypes. </p>
