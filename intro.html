        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing field that has the potential to revolutionize the way we live, work, and interact with the world (Zafari, Bazargani, Sadeghi-Hiaraki, & Choi, 2022; Yang & Zhang, 2019). AI is already transforming many industries, from healthcare and finance to manufacturing, business, and transportation. With the widespread adoption of AI technologies, there will be a growing demand for skilled professionals who can design, develop, and implement these systems. As the demand for AI professionals continues to increase and its potential to create significant social and economic benefits, the need for comprehensive AI education is becoming more critical. However, there are also concerns about the impact of AI on human life, jobs, and society. Without adequate education and training, many people may be left behind or vulnerable of using AI technologies, and the benefits of AI may only accrue to a small group of people (Hsu, Lee, Hwang, & Wu, 2021). By educating people about AI, we can ensure that everyone has the opportunity to participate in and benefit from the AI revolution as well as be aware of potential risks and ethical issues of using AI technologies (Choi, 2022; Yang & Zhang, 2019).</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Additionally, AI is a complex and rapidly evolving field that requires interdisciplinary knowledge and skills educated through K-12 education (Bokas, 2018; Gajar, & Malik, 2019; Kwee, Kummerfeld, & Pardos, 2020). To be successful in this field, individuals need to have a strong foundation in computer science, statistics, mathematics, and engineering, among other fields. As AI technology continues to advance at an unprecedented pace, it is becoming increasingly important to integrate AI in K-12 education to significantly improve the learning experience and outcomes for students as well as bridge this gap and prepare students for the potential job demand generated along with AI technologies (UNESCO, 2019; Evans, Twining, Fernandez, & Yoon, 2019; Gajar, & Malik, 2019; NSTC, 2016). </p>
	 	</blockquote>
	 	
	 	<p>To collaborate with a middle school at Northeast Ohio, the goal of this study is to explore how an AI Exploration Day workshop can promote: 1) 8th graders’ awareness of potential benefits and risks of AI technologies in real-life experience, 2) students’ understanding of how AI technologies are designed to support the needs in real-life experience, and 3) students’ interests of knowledge and skills of applying AI technologies to support their learning. Through participating in the AI Exploration day workshop, students will be introduced to 1) basic concepts of AI technologies, 2) have opportunities to explore different types/application of AI technologies and the knowledge and skills needed to develop the AI technologies, and 3) participate in the competition of the AI Problem-Based Learning (AI-PBL) project to apply problem-solving skills to solve a real-life problem, such as incorporating AI technologies to enhance summer experience (Lee & Tan, 2019; Greiffenhagen & Mavrikis, 2019; Chai, et. al, 2019; Oosthuizen & van der Merwe, 2019).</p>
	 	</blockquote>

	 	<p>By completing this study, the middle school and researchers were able to examine if this workshop training and problem-based learning project effectively raised students’ learning motivation/satisfaction and awareness of AI technologies. The results of this study were utilized to inform the school district to integrate AI education into the K-12 curriculum effectively.</p>
